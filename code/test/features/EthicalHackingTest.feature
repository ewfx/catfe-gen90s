Feature: Ethical Hacking Test for Web Application Security

  Background:
    Given a valid application URL is provided for testing
    And the ethical hacking module is initialized

  Scenario: Perform Reconnaissance
    When the system performs a reconnaissance scan on the application
    Then it should gather information about the application infrastructure
    And identify potential entry points and exposed services

  Scenario: Detect Vulnerabilities with Automated Scanning
    When the system scans the application for vulnerabilities
    Then it should detect known vulnerabilities using automated scanners
    And generate a preliminary vulnerability report

  Scenario: Perform SQL Injection Test
    Given a web form with user input fields
    When the system attempts SQL injection attacks
    Then it should identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
    And log any database errors or abnormal behavior

  Scenario: Perform XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Test
    Given a web application with input fields that accept user data
    When the system attempts XSS attacks using malicious scripts
    Then it should detect any XSS vulnerabilities
    And report any successful script execution attempts

  Scenario: Perform Authentication and Authorization Test
    When the system tests authentication and authorization mechanisms
    Then it should identify weak password policies and session management issues
    And verify if unauthorized access is possible

  Scenario: Perform Denial of Service (DoS) Test
    When the system attempts to simulate a denial-of-service attack
    Then it should detect the applicationâ€™s resilience to traffic spikes
    And report any downtime or degraded performance

  Scenario: Generate Comprehensive Security Report
    When the testing is completed
    Then the system should generate a detailed security report
    And categorize the vulnerabilities by severity
    And recommend remediation steps for each identified issue
